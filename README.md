# 12-tone-matrix-calculator-generator
These simple scripts have been made for music composers. 
The first one calculates 12-tone matrix using input string (in latin system) and exports the matrix to Microsoft Excel file (.xlsx).
The second one does the same, but the matrix is generated randomly.
Both scripts have an option to export P-form of the seria in midicents value, that gives you an opportunity to use it in another software (OpenMusic, for example).
