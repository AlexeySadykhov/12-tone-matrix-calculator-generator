# 12-tone-matrix-calculator-generator
This simple script has been made for music composers. 
It calculates 12-tone matrix using input string (in latin system) and exports the matrix to Microsoft Excel file (.xlsx).
If input string is empty then matrix is generated randomly.
Also, script has an option to export a P-form of the seria in midicents value, that gives you an opportunity to use it in another software (OpenMusic, for example).
